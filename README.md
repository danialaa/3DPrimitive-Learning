 An application to teach simple 3d primitive properties.  
 <br/>
 ## System Overview:  
   
   ![system](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52839918/149686146-d0c11d50-158a-4638-94ac-d0cc2e84eaed.png)
  <br/>
   The system was implemented using a simplified approach of the MVC design pattern and state pattern (used when switching between shapes).  
   <br/>
 ## Usage:
 
   On start, the system presents a simple UI to choose the preferred primitive shape and color.  
   On hitting the submit button, the system loads the shape with the selected data and the user can rotate the shape by dragging the mouse.  
   The top-right setting button can be clicked anytime during the run to change the shape's data.
